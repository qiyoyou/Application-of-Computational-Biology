## Application of Machine learning approaches in default of credit card data from UCI Machine Learning Repository

**Default of credit card data** [[link to UCI page]](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients)

We applied machine learning approaches including support vector machine (SVM) and classification tree (CART) to build prediction models for credit card default status. The models are evaulated with cross-validation accuracy rate. The final CART model has accuracy rate up to 80% and the dendrogram provides better explanation for credit card.
